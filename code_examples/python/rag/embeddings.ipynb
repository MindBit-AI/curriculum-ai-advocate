(If you think I'm making \\nthis up, I can supply the names.) Only in the summer of 1988 did \\nmy brain finally establish contact with my eyes.\\n\\n     What I then perceived was both clear and fascinating. After \\ndrifting somewhat in the 1970's, Coca-Cola had in 1981 become a \\nnew company with the move of Roberto Goizueta to CEO. Roberto, \\nalong with Don Keough, once my across-the-street neighbor in \\nOmaha, first rethought and focused the company's policies and \\nthen energetically carried them out. What was already the world's \\nmost ubiquitous product gained new momentum, with sales overseas \\nvirtually exploding.\")]"
