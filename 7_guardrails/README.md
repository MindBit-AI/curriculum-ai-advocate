# Module 7: Implementing Guardrails for LLMs

This module focuses on implementing guardrails for Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure safe, ethical, and reliable AI applications.

## What are Guardrails?

Guardrails are constraints or protocols that help control LLM behavior, prevent misuse, and ensure alignment with intended use cases. They can:

- Block harmful, toxic, or inappropriate content
- Protect sensitive information (like PII)
- Ensure factuality and prevent hallucinations
- Maintain compliance with regulations and policies
- Establish boundaries for user interactions

## Folder Structure

- **homework/** - Contains the practical exercises
  - **star/** - Additional challenges for advanced students
  - **solution/** - Example implementation of guardrails

## Getting Started

The `solution` folder contains an example implementation of PII (Personal Identifiable Information) guardrails for LLM interactions. This code demonstrates how to:

1. Detect different types of PII in user inputs
2. Block or redact sensitive information before sending to an LLM
3. Implement graceful handling when PII is detected

## Running the Examples

To run the PII guardrails example:

```bash
cd 7_guardrails/homework/solution
python pii_guardrails.py
```

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you should be able to:

- Understand the importance of guardrails in responsible AI development
- Implement different types of guardrails for various use cases
- Design systems that balance usability with safety and compliance
- Test and evaluate the effectiveness of your guardrails

## Exercise

The `star` folder contains additional challenges for you to extend the basic guardrails implementation. Try implementing:

1. Toxicity detection and filtering
2. Topic boundary guardrails (to keep conversations on approved topics)
3. Custom guardrails for your specific use case
