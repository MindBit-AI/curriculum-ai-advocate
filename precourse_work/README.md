# To-do List Before Your First Class

We're excited to have you get started with the course! To make sure you're ready for the first class, please complete the following:

- **Come up with a project idea!** 

    You'll need to come up with your own AI project to build during the course. This should be something you're excited about and that you're passionate about, but also something that's feasible to build in the time we have. 
    
    Use the following resources to help you come up with an idea:
    - [AI Project Ideas](./ai_project_ideas.md)
    - [AI Project Planning Document](./ai_project_planning_doc.md)

- **Do the class 1 prework** 

    Head over to the [class 1 prework](../class_1/prework) and follow the instructions to complete the prework before class starts.

We look forward to meeting with you and thank you for taking this course. We hope you're as excited as we are!
