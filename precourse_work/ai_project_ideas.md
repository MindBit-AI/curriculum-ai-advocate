## Selecting Your AI Project
A key component of this course is to build a project of your own choosing. This course is only four weeks long, so the project should be relatively simple. It is something you should be able to do based on your schedule in the four-week time period. The project doesn’t have to be a success, but it should give you enough to understand the various components and challenges of an AI project. 

Identifying a simple project that leverages AI can be challenging, but there's a lof of simple tasks that just couldn't be automated before that can with generative AI. A lot of “low hanging fruit” exists that you can build in this course that can add significant value to your work, and that's what we recommend you build (there's plenty to pick from!). 

### Tips on finding a project

Before we can pick a project, it's helpful to know what we should be looking for. What use cases make for good AI projects? Here are some helpful tips to finding these simple and effective projects that you can build during this class.

- Any task that requires a human to read something and act on what they read can be done by AI. Large language models are incredible at digesting unstructured text like blogs, code, contracts, emails, etc. 
- AI needs context to do a task, so anything where you have information or data that can be used to complete a task gives you a big head start. Context can be data, examples of outputs, written-out processes, and more. Basically the more you can give a large language model today, the less context you’ll need to find today. 
- Your AI project should not aim to do 100% of the work. Instead, a human should review the AI content before it is used. Focus on tasks that are low-energy tasks (e.g. reading 100 job applications to find the best candidates) and then let the human step in again.
- Pick a use case you are familiar with. Avoid needing an “expert” to tell you what is right and what is wrong. You should be that person. That way you know how to guide the AI to do your bidding. 

### Project Ideas

If you are having trouble identifying an AI use case you want to build towards, you can use the project list below as inspiration.

- Email/Slack summarizer and responder
- Calendar generator
- Data labeler
Chatbot
- Video transcript generator/summarizer/chapter generator
- Meeting summarizer
- Document generator

By the beginning of our first class, you should have a good idea of what you want to build. We’ve provided a document with a few questions to help you flush out your idea so you can be set up for success on day 1. If you need help identifying your project idea, reach out to the Discord channel and we can help you brainstorm some ideas.
