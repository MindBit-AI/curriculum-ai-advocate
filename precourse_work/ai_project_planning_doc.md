Instructions: Create a google doc for yourself that answers the following quetions so that we can help you build out a viable projects using the concetps you learn in this course.  We will refer to this document throughout your learning experience, this is not a throw-away experience, think of this as your design doc as you continue build.

Answer the following questions to help you identify a project use case:

**1. What is the use case that you want to address with your AI project?**

_Example: Determine whether movie reviews are positive or negative._

**2. What data do you currently have that you can use in this project?**

_Example: Rotten Tomatoes has reviews and the sentiment analysis_

**3. What data do you currently not have that you will need to gather for this project?**

_Example: Transcripts from YouTube videos_

**4. Provide one to three examples of ideal inputs and outputs for your project. (If you canâ€™t come up with examples, that may be a sign that this project is not a good fit for this class)**

_Example: 
Input: This film shouldn't work at all. It doesn't have much of a story and the whole dial up internet thing is incredibly dated. However, Hanks and Ryan sell it beautifully._
_Output: Positive_

_Input: The clumsily loaded characterisation not only treats almost every other figure as dispensable, but doesn't even bother to make Meg and Tom properly sympathetic.
Output: Negative_

_Input: Mail may not be as romantic as Sleepless, but it's wittier.
Output: Positive_
