### The student must demonstrate...

1. Be able to produce a langgraph architecture

## Coding Problems

1. **Overview of LangGraph**
   
   - **Core Competency:** Understand each LangGraph component and it's place in the framework
   
   - **Relevance:** LangGraph offers a modular way to build AI apps. This is useful for many cases, and leverages many of the same concepts from agents, but in a more controlled way.
   
   - **Procedure:**
      1. Introduce components: Nodes, Edges, State, Conditional edges
      2. Node - a single function that runs an event
      3. Edges - connections between nodes that dictate the path
      4. Conditional Edges
      5. State - Where we are in the current realm of things
      6. Use cases
      
   - **Code:**
    
    - **Check For Understanding:** 

1. **Graph Architectures**
   
   - **Core Competency:** Apply different architectural structures in different settings
   
   - **Relevance:** Understanding how graphs can be constructed helps identify how it can be used
   
   - **Procedure:**
      1. Router
      2. Supervisor
      3. Hierarchal
      4. Reflection
      
   - **Code:**
    
    - **Check For Understanding:** 

1. **Building a LangGraph solution**
   
   - **Core Competency:** Apply different architectural structures in different settings
   
   - **Relevance:** Understanding how graphs can be constructed helps identify how it can be used
   
   - **Procedure:**
      1. What goes in state
      2. What do nodes return
      3. parallization
      4. reflection
      
   - **Code:**
    
    - **Check For Understanding:**
