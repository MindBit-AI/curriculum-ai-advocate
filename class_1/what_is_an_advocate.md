# What is an Advocate?

Advocates are people who are knowledgable in a given topic and help others understand the space. With new technologies (like generative AI), advocates can help businesses discover use cases and build solutions using the new tech. 

What we have found is that businesses want to use generative AI, but they don't know how. They need an advocate, and that's where you will come in. You will help your company understand the strengths and limitations of generative AI so you can help guide your company and build solutions that bring value.

## The Path to Becoming an Advocate

Becoming an advocate requires that you have a solid foundational understanding of generative AI concepts and how they can be applied. That's why in this course we dive deep into these concepts and share many use cases from our own expereince to expose you to what this tech is capabalbe of. 

When we say we dive deep into a concept, we mean it. Each class is only 45 minutes long, and we cover a lot of material in that time. We plan these classes to be impactful from the minute we start to the end, covering important concepts, code examples, and real life experiences.

We've provided prework to be done before each class. Prework is mainly reading to familiarize yourself with the concept we'll cover in class and should take around 10 minutes to complete. We highly encourage you to read this prework. The class will go deeper into the concepts, and we will start each class where the prework ends. 

By the end of this course, you will have the knoweldge and experiences needed to be a thought leader in generative AI and build incredibly valueable applications, but advocates don't just take a class and leave. You have to keep learning, and we want to help you with that journey. That's why we offer continual access to our Discord server so we can learn together into the future. We will share ideas and code, talk about the latest generative AI news, and be supports for one another. 

## Building Your Solution

The one deliverable for this course is to build your own geneartive AI application. As part of this process, it is imperative that you come up with your own project idea, and we want you to be ambitious. Even before you come to the first class, you should start thinking of ideas of what you want to build. We will provide a design template to help you outline what you will use for your application and we will be available to discuss and review your plan. Once your plan is set, you should start building it. Your project is your captstone, and as such we won't be giving you any extra work to do outside of class (outside of prework).

## Expectations for this Course

We've already covered the expectations, but here's a summary:

- do all class prework (10-20 minutes)
- attend class (50 minutes)
- build your own solution

We also expect you to be engaged with us on Discord. Send us your plan, ask questions, reach out to others taking this course, etc. This colloboration will help in articulating ideas, increase your understanding, and build the best solutions.
