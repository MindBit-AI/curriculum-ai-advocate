# Class 1 Homework Assignments

This directory contains three homework assignments that reinforce the key concepts covered in Class 1: LLMs, Prompts, and Structured Outputs.

## Assignment Structure
Each assignment has two folders:
- `start/`: Contains the boilerplate code with key parts removed for you to complete
- `solution/`: Contains the complete solution (only look at this after attempting the assignment!)

## Getting Started
1. Choose an assignment to work on
2. Navigate to its `start/` directory
3. Read the comments in the code to understand what needs to be completed
4. Complete the missing code sections
