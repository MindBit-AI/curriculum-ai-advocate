# Prework: Day 2 - RAG

Welcome to day day of the AI Advocate course! Every class has prework that you are expected to complete _before_ class. We aim for prework to take 10 and 20 minutes to complete.

For today's prework, you'll setup a vector database. This will be useful as we talk about retrieval-agumented generation (RAG).

Complete the following:

- [Setting up a Vector Database with Pinecone](prework_1.md)
- [Prepping Your Environment for Class 2](../class_code/README.md)
