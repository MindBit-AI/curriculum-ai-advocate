# Prepping Your Environment for Class 2

For today's class, you'll want to be sure your environment is set up properly.

Open your terminal and go to this project's root directory (curriculum_ai_advocate).

From there, run the following commands:

1. Make sure you're virtual environment is set up and activate it:

```
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install the all the libraries you'll need for today by running:

```
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Now navigate to `class_2/class_code` and run `embeddings_example.py`:

```
cd class_2/class_code
python embeddings_example.py
```

If you see a list of movie descriptions, you're ready for class!

If not, go back and make sure you were able to run all the steps. Reach out on Discord if you need help.

See you in class!
